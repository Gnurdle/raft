# raft

A implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm written in
Clojure. This implementation has a heavy emphasis on providing an
algorithm disentangled as much as possible from concerns like network
transport.

This implementation provides a function `com.manigfeald.raft/raft`
that creates a value that describes the state of the algorithm, and a
function `com.manigfeald.raft/run-one` that steps a given state of the
algorithm to the next state.

The state of the raft algorithm is described in five records:

1. ImplementationState
   - The overall container of the rest of the state
2. Timer
   - a number representing now
   - a number representing the next timeout
   - the period between timeouts
3. IO
   - a possible message received
   - a PersistentQueue of messages to send out
4. RaftState
   - raft state common to all nodes
5. RaftLeaderState
   - raft state used by the leader node

## Why is this so weird?

You can think of it more as a model of a Raft implementation, but the
model is in clojure so it is easy enough to just wire the model in to
some transports and run it. Like wiring in to a spreadsheet model, but
without the instinctive gag reflex of wiring in to a spreadsheet.
